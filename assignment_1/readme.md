# Assignment 1: Simple image search algorithm

## Description of the assignment
This project uses OpenCV and the ’17 Category Flower Dataset’ to create a simple image search algorithm, which compares a ‘target flower’ to the rest of the dataset. It does so by creating a normalized colour histogram of each flower, comparing it to that of the target flower, displaying the top five flowers and saving the results as a CSV file in the out folder.

```

3. Run the setup script to install opencv-python, pandas, and numpy. It simultaneously creates a virtual environment containing the specific versions used to develop this project. 
```sh
bash setup.sh
```
4. To activate the environment and run the main script, simply run the run script.
```sh
bash run.sh
```
