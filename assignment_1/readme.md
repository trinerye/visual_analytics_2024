# Assignment 1: Simple image search algorithm

## Description of the assignment
This project uses OpenCV and the ’17 Category Flower Dataset’ to create a simple image search algorithm, which compares a ‘target flower’ to the rest of the dataset. It does so by creating a normalized colour histogram of each flower, comparing it to that of the target flower, displaying the top five flowers and saving the results as a CSV file in the out folder. 


## Installation

 1. Clone the repository using Git 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/trinerye/visual_analytics_2024.git
```

2. Change directory to the assignment folder 
```sh
cd assignment_1
```

3. Before running the script make sure to install opencv-python, pandas, and numpy by running the setup.sh using a bash terminal. It simutanously create a virtual enviroment which contains the package versions used to make this script. 
```sh
bash setup.sh
```
4. To run the script run the run.sh file from the same bash terminal 
```sh
bash run.sh
```

## Usage
